// Video Sync Generator
//     (altera_avalon_video_sync_generator.v)
//
// Author: chang
//
// OVERVIEW
//    This IP core is the output stage of a video-pipeline. The outputs
//    from this core can be directly-connected to an LCD display panel
//    (e.g. Toppoly TD043MTEA1).    
// 
//     This core adds H-sync and V-sync signals to an incoming stream of
//     B,G,R pixel-data.   Also, it "meters" the delivery of 
//     the B,G,R stream so bytes and sync-signals are produced on the
//     output with correct timing for the LCD display.
//
// DEPLOYMENT
//     This core is implemented as an SOPC Builder component with a
//     single Avalon-ST data-sink (input) and LCD-driving export
//     (output) signals. An associated TCL Metadata file declares this
//     core and  its interfaces for use in an SOPC Builder system.
//
//     One noteworthy & unusual feature is that this core sports no
//     Avalon-MM slave whatsoever.  You couldn't talk to it with your
//     CPU even if you wanted to.  It's purpose in life is to condition a
//     stream of pixel-data and stream it to an off-chip LCD display
//     with correct timing.
//         
// PLACEMENT IN A SYSTEM
//     The outputs from this core can directly drive an LCD display
//     module.  The input is a sequential stream of BGR pixel-data in
//     row-major order.  An Avalon-ST SOP (Start-Of-Packet) pulse
//     marks the first pixel in each frame.
//
//     This core is completely agnostic about the pixel-data
//     source. In a typical application, an Avalon-ST FIFO would drive BGR
//     data to this component.  The ultimate data-source might be a
//     frame-buffer in memory (via a DMA), or some external video
//     source.  This component doesn't care.  It just takes a stream
//     of incoming pixel-data and delivers it to an LCD display with
//     correct timing, accompanied by synchronization signals.
//
// PARAMETERS
//     The low-level timing of the H-sync and V-sync waveforms (and
//     pixel-delivery) are determined by the various timing
//     parameters.  Different displays and different resolutions may
//     require different timing parameters.  These parameters have
//     been named to agree with terminology used in the Toppoly
//     TD043MTEA1 datasheet.  These are fairly-typical names for these
//     kinds of timing parameters.
//
//     The default values of these parameters are suitable for
//     connection to the TD043MTEA1 panel.
//
// ERROR CONDITIONS
//     Under normal operation, the incoming pixel-data stream will
//     never "run dry" (in other words: the Avalon-ST source will
//     always have a "valid" datum whenever this module's Avalon-ST
//     sink is "ready.")  If a condition arises wherein the source is
//     not signalling "valid" when this core is signalling "ready,"
//     then the behavior of the outputs for the remainder of that
//     frame-time (packet) is undefined.
//
//     It is the responsibility of the system-designer to make sure
//     the data-source for this core never "runs dry."  If it does,
//     the result will (temporarily) be garbage on the LCD-display.
//
// PACKETS = FRAMES
//     The incoming data is assumed to contain the correct number of
//     pixels (LCD_NUM_ROWS * LCD_NUM_COLUMNS) in a packet.  Packets
//     with fewer or more pixels will result in undefined behavior on
//     the LCD screen.  Every first beat of every packet (=frame)
//     must be accompanied by a SOP (start-of-packet) pulse on the
//     Avalon-ST interface.
//
// HOW SYNCHRONIZATION WORKS.
//     This core is the synchronization source.  It is a free-running
//     sync-generator.  There's nothing you can do to stop it (well,
//     OK.  You can assert reset_n).  Other than that: It comes out of
//     reset and runs forever, frame-sequence after frame-sequence,
//     nonstop.  Whether there's incoming data or not.
//
//     That's a key point, which is why I'm emphasizing it.  This is a
//     free-running generator of timing waveforms, which runs forever
//     and always does the same thing.  This has some cardinal
//     benefits:
//           * It's behavior is easy to explain...
//           * And easy to implement...
//           * And easy to document...
//           * And easy to test.
//
//     So.  If this thing runs all the time, how can we be sure that
//     the first pixel in a frame (=packet) is presented to the LCD
//     screen at the right point in the H/Vsync sequence? (In other
//     words, how does this core synchronize the video datastream with
//     the video H/V timing waveforms?)
//
//     Easy.  It just holds-off the incoming datastream (by setting
//     ready=0 on its Avalon-ST sink).  The datasource (whatever it
//     is) tells us that some particular pixel is the first one in a
//     frame by asserting SOP for that pixel. If this core sees "SOP"
//     on its input, then it will HOLD the incoming datastream *until
//     the appropriate time in the sync sequence*.  The appropriate
//     time to present the first pixel happens to be: the first pixel
//     when DEN is true after the next Vsync (VD) signal.  
//     So: This core responds to a SOP by "backpressuring" the
//     incoming data stream until the next new frame rolls-around.
//
//     And, as we said before: The frame-sequence is always rolling,
//     and never stops.
//
// B,G,R TIME-MULTIPLEXING
//     The initial deployment of this core is in the Nios Embedded
//     Software Evaluation Kit (EEK).  this core drives signals to an
//     LCD-display daughtercard assembly, attached through an HSMC
//     connector.  In this particular hardware configuration, this
//     core's outputs are not connected directly to the Toppoly LCD
//     display module.  Instead, they are connected to an Altera MAX
//     chip (on the daughtercard).  This MAX chip allows the B,G,and R
//     datastreams to be time-multiplexed over the same 8 wires.
//     Thus: (BGR) data is presented as "triplets" of three clocks
//     each on the same 8 wires running to the daughtercard.
//
//
//         +--------+                   +------+        +---------------+
//         |        |        [H]        |      |---/--->| R             |
//   B,G,R |  This  | B,G,R  [S] B,G,R  |      |   8    |               |
//   --/-->|  Core  |----/-->[M]---/--->| MAX  |---/--->| G    LCD      |
//     8   |        |    8   [C]   8    |      |   8    |     Display   |
//         +--------+                   |      |---/--->| B             |
//                                      +------+   8    +---------------+
//
//               Configuration for EEK daughtercard
//                  (clocks and sync-signals omitted for clarity)
//
// 
//    In this configuration, each pixel in the datastream is
//    represented by three consecutive "beats" of data on the
//    Avalon-ST input.
//
//    That's great for the EEK, but this core would be much more
//    useful if it could also drive LCD screens which didn't happen to
//    reside on a daughtercard.  And, of course, it can.
//
//    Because this core doesn't really *do anything* with the
//    pixel-data, it doesn't really care about how wide it is, or what
//    it means.  The only "operational" part of the incoming Avalon-ST
//    input interface is the SOP pulse--the rest of the data is just
//    payload which we ignore.
//
//    Consequently: This core can be parameterized to accept a pixel
//    datastream of any bit-width (DATA_STREAM_BIT_WIDTH), and one
//    pixel can be divided into any number of "beats" on the Avalon-ST
//    interface (BEATS_PER_PIXEL). These two parameters allow this
//    core to be used directly with an LCD display module, or with the
//    module attached through some sort of EEK-daughtercard-like
//    multiplexing scheme.
//
// CLOCKING
//     The "clk" input to this core serves as the timebase.  The core
//     delivers one "beat" per clock.  Note that this is NOT the same
//     as one pixel per clock, because pixels might (or might not) be
//     broken-up into multiple beats.  In other words, you can
//     configure this core to pass-through a 24-bit (R,G,B) stream, or
//     you can configure it to pass-through an 8-bit stream which
//     transferrs B, G, and R, pixel-data bytewise-sequentially, three
//     clocks per pixel.  This is determined by the BEATS_PER_PIXEL parameter.
//
// REGISTERED OUTPUTS
//     The several synchronization pulses are
//     computed as decodes from counters.  We need to run these
//     through simple synchronization delay-registers, otherwise they
//     *will* glitch, and the display will do who-knows-what.
//
//     Because we register all the sync-outputs, we also have to
//     register the pixel-data...or else it will be out-of-sync with
//     the sync pulses--and you wouldn't want that.
//
//     And, it would appear: the MAX chip expects our data to be produced
//     on the *rising* edge of the clock. So this core is written to (optionally)
//     produce its RGB-data and sync-signals with posedge output-timing.
//
// HARD SYNCHRONIZATION (Just-barely-unimplemented feature)
//     As-designed, this core comes out of reset generating
//     frame-sequences, and keeps generating them forever.  It's only
//     time-reference is the reset_n signal (and the clock, of
//     course).  And that's the way it is.
//
//     But I can imagine the day when someone might want to *force*
//     the LCD-display frame-update to be synchronized with some other
//     source.  So: Built-into all the counters is a "sync_reset"
//     signal. This signal is tied to zero (1'b0) at the top-level of
//     this module.  But if, one day, you want to expose this external
//     signal: just run "sync_reset" to the top and drive it any way
//     you want.
